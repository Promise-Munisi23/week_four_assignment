# week_four_assignment

This project contains two Python programs:

    File Read & Write: Reads a file, modifies its content (e.g., converts text to uppercase), and writes the result to a new file.

    Error Handling Lab: Prompts the user for a filename and handles errors if the file doesn't exist or can't be read.

Features

    Reads and modifies file content.

        Writes modified content to a new file.

    Handles errors gracefully (e.g., file not found, read/write errors).

Requirements

    Python 3.x

Usage

    File Read & Write:

        Create an input.txt file with content.

                Run the script to modify and save the output to output.txt.

    Error Handling Lab:

        Run the script and input a filename.

        The program will handle errors if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read.
